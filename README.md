# userscript-youtube_hideRecommendedForYouPersonalizedRelatedVideos
Hide the "Recommended for you" videos on the Youtube side bar, because those aren't related to the current video (they're stupid personalized suggestions).

(2017-06-23: also note that youtube is lame and shows personalized videos that aren't labeled "Recommended for you". So like, I can watch a dog video and it will recommend lots of anime and music playlists. I'm sure that's related to the dog video! So uh, I thought I was going to either label this section "Retarded videos", or otherwise block all videos that aren't by the author of the current playing video. I ended up doing the latterâ€”now most suggestion boxes are empty! How lame of you...tube. All they had to do was copy Amazon's carousels with the labels like "other users purchased" or "other users looked at", and do something similar for personalized (LAME) recommendations versus related videos versus same-channel videos. So easy! But they didn't do it so here's this happy-go-fuck-everything script instead.)
